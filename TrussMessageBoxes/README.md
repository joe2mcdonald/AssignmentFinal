=======
Shows a variety of CSS message boxes.

### Operation:
------
**1.  Run truss-message-boxes.html
To view the varity of message boxes that are available.  
Choose the HTML <div> 'message box(es)' that you need. 

**2. HTML file
Include CSS files (normalize.css and truss-message-boxes-style.css) in the `<head>` of your HTML site. 
The truss-message-boxes-style.css contains the style for the message boxes. 
```html
<head>
	<link href="css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">    
	<link href="css/truss-message-boxes-style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" >
</head>
````html
 
Include the HTML <div> tag for each 'message box' that you want to use in your site.
Modify the message for the box in the HTML <div> tag. 

**3. CSS file
It is not necessary for you to modify the CSS file. 
But if you do or want to incorporate the CSS into your style sheet. 
The first two blocks of CSS code in the truss-message-boxes-style.css CSS style sheet file and the block that matches the class in the HTML <div> tag are necessary.  
If desired remove the 'message box' classes that are not used. 

**4. You should not feel constrained by the way I have built the initial code. 
If you disagree with how something has been done, feel free to revise it for the needs of your particular site.
