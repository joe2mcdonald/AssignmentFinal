=======
Shows a variety of CSS message boxes.

### Operation:
------
**1.  Run truss-message-boxes.html
To view the varity of message boxes that are available.  
Choose the HTML <div> 'message box(es)' that you need. 

**2. HTML file
Include CSS files (normalize.css and truss-message-boxes-style.css) in the `<head>` of your HTML site. 
The truss-message-boxes-style.css contains the style for the message boxes. 
```html
<head>
	<link href="css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">    
	<link href="css/truss-message-boxes-style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" >
</head>
````html
 
Include the HTML <div> tag for each 'message box' that you want to use in your site.
Modify the message for the box in the HTML <div> tag. 

**3. CSS file
The first two blocks of CSS code in the style sheet file and the block that matches the class in the HTML <div> tag are necessary.  
If desired remove the 'message box' classes that are not used. 

**4. You should not feel constrained by the way I have built the initial code. 
If you disagree with how something has been done, feel free to revise it for the needs of your particular site.
