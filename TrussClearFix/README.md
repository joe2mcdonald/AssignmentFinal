Truss ClearFix, helper class that clear floats without resorting to using presentational markup.

### Operation:
------
**1. Stylesheet For Truss Clearfix.
Either use the truss-clearfix.css stylesheet or add the CSS code in your own stylesheet.

**2. HTML file
In the HTML <head> 
Put in the link to the truss-clearfix.css stylesheet file that contains the 
CSS truss clearfix helper class.
Specify the class name - class = "tclearfix" - in your HTML container. 
See the example below.

```html
<head>
<!-- Truss Clearfix stylesheet --> 
<link href="css/truss-clearfix.css"  rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
</head>

<div class = "tclearfix">
......
</div>
/body>
````html

**3. CSS file
Include the stylesheet "truss-clearfix.css" file in the CSS folder or put the 
code from the truss-clearfix.css in your CSS stylesheet file. 

**4. You should not feel constrained by the way I have built the initial code. 
If you disagree with how something that has been done, feel free to revise 
it for the needs of your particular site.
