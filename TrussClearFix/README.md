Truss ClearFix, helper class that clear floats without resorting to using presentational markup.
Based on Nicolas Gallagher - "micro" clearfix.

### Operation:
------
**1. Stylesheet For Clearfix.
Either use the truss-clearfix.css stylesheet or add the CSS code in your own stylesheet.

**2. HTML file
In the HTML <head> 
Put the link to the truss-clearfix.css stylesheet file that contains CSS clearfix helper class.
Specify the class name - class="container" - in you HTML container. 
See the example below.
-->	 

```html
<head>
<!-- Clearfix  stylesheet --> 
<link href="css/truss-clearfix.css"  rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
</head>
````html

**3. CSS file
Include the stylesheet "truss-clearfix.css" file or the css file where you have included the code in the css folder. 

**4. You should not feel constrained by the way I have built the initial code.
