=======
A grid template that shows grids for 4 different column variations: 16, 12, 6, 4. 
And 5 different major breakpoints for each:
   Large Desktop Layout - 1200px and more,  
   Tablet Landscape and Desktop Layout - 960px to 1199px, 
   Tablet Portrait Layout - 768px to 959px, 
   Mobile Landscape Layout - 480px to 767px,   
   Mobile Portrait Layout - to 479px,

### Operation:
------
**2. Include CSS files (normalize.css and Truss-Grid.css) in your html. The Truss-Grid.css contains the grid dimentions.  To use this file, simply include the css in the `<head>` of the HTML page.
```html
<head>
	<link  href="css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
	<link href="css/Truss-Grid.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
</head>
```
These styles do not automatically make up a finished site design. They are simply a starting point, ideally for rapid prototyping or as a basis for creating your own designs. 
You should not feel constrainedby the way I have built the initial code. If you disagree with how something has been done, feel free to revise it for the needs of your particular site.

**2. Run the Truss-Grid.html file inorder to view the different variations of columns and the breakpoints when the browser is resized.  Modify the HTML file and choose the matching classes that you need. And remove the remaining html columns.
